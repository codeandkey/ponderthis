### December 2017 solution

No brute-forcing was used to solve this one, as the pattern was derived entirely on paper.
However, this means that the program isn't very useful for solving any other graph sizes.

The solution is outputted to `sol`, with 100 nodes and between every pair of nodes there exists a path of no more than 27 hops.
